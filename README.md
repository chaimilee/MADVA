# MADVA

Our motivation for creating MADVA (Master's in Applied Data science Virtual Advisor) was to help our fellow Applied Data Science students avoid obstacles and better prepare ourselves for the coming semester and achieve our career goals. This app would significantly reduce stress during registration periods and help students plan future courses based on their interests and other students' experiences. This app would also be helpful for students who have less flexible schedules due to jobs, being in a different time zone, etc. With MADVA, our goal is to ensure that current and future DSCI students make the best out of their educational journey at USC.
